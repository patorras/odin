                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over 
                            them. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as 
                            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript 
                            can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with 
                            additional objects; for example: 
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
                                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                                For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                                clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
                                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, 
                                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a 
                                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to 
                                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
                    </header>

                    <article>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally 
                            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but 
                            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions 
                            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was 
                            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by 
                            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small 
                            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. 
                            JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more 
                            common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides 
                            dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for 
                            individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any 
                            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of 
                            objects, executing as loosely typed methods. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not 
                            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have 
                            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, 
                            and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, 
                            and function return types are not explicitly typed. 
                        </p>
